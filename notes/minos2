traverse grid, skip any columns that are filled, if column is empty check if next piece fits, if it
does  place piece, move 1 column repeat
if next piece doesn't fit, check other pieces in order and if a piece fits, place piece, go back to orig. move 1
	if other pieces don't fit, go back to original piece move 1 column, repeat
traverse grid from start

if the next piece doesn't fit because it's end of grid, and piece does not fit, revert back to piece before it and move 
1 column
repeat;
